Just clone the repo and open the index.html file in your favourite browser to see the test page.

The CSS could definitely benefit from a more structured approach. I was aiming for a a BEM style structure but I was pressed for time.

Performance could also be improved by using a local font instead of relying on a external remote font that might be slow to load (eg. Abchanel font).

Have fun :)
